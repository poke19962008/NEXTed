# NEXTed (Imagine Cup 2016)

We believe in fixing the education system and improving the way how things work in a regular schooling system. This is what everybody has observed but no effective initiative has been taken yet. We have build a peer to peer learning and encouraging platform for students as well as teachers.

- This way a student will get a platform to upload his skills , achievements, experiences and awards and inspire people around him. He'll be able to check the other students' profiles and get inspired.

- A teacher will be able to upload his area of expertise , degrees and awards.Teachers with skills apart from their designated area can be approached by students with similar interests.Hence making Learning smarter.

- A School will become smarter by making a network of students and teachers and connecting them on the basis of their common interests. Hence overall development of students will take place.This way careers which are not appreciated nowadays or generally considered as risky careers will also get explored by students.
